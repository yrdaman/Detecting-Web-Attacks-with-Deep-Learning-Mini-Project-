# 🔐 Detecting Web Attacks with Deep Learning - Mini Project

A mini-project that utilizes deep learning techniques to detect and classify various types of web-based attacks such as SQL Injection, XSS, and DDoS. The system is built using Django for the frontend/backend, with machine learning models like AutoEncoders, SVM, Naive Bayes, and LSTM handling the detection logic.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build an intelligent, end-to-end system that automatically detects web attacks by analyzing structured and unstructured web request data using deep learning models. This system provides an adaptive and scalable alternative to traditional rule-based intrusion detection systems.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Upload and preprocess web traffic datasets  
✅ Train and compare multiple ML/DL algorithms:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- AutoEncoder-based anomaly detection
- LSTM-based sequential threat detection

✅ Visualize model performance (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)  
✅ OTP-based secure login system  
✅ Real-time prediction and classification of test data

## 🔒 Security Notes

- OTP system is implemented using Gmail SMTP  
- Use environment variables for email credentials  
- SQL queries should be parameterized to prevent SQL Injection
